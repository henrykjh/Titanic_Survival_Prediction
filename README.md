# Titanic_Survival_Prediction
### CSE351 (Introduction to Data Science) in-class Project  

*Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key survival factors, focusing on socio-economic class, age, gender, and family relationships.*  

*Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by removing outliers and imputing missing values using linear regression predictions.*  

*Transformed categorical features into numerical data and use Cram√©r's V to analyze the relationship between categorical data.*  

*Built and trained predictive models including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gradient Boosting classifiers.*  

*Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score; applied cross-validation for robust validation and model tuning.*  

*Identified socio-economic status and gender as critical predictors through correlation analysis and visualizations.*
